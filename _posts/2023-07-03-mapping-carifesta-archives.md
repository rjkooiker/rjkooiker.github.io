## Where is your archive?

Or: What's your archive? 

These are questions I often get asked by fellow researchers and academics--especially historians. I forgive them for asking, since I *am* a scholar who works on a historical project, involving the recovery and the telling of a little-known story, the story of the Caribbean Festival of the Arts.

In response to those questions, I made my map of Carifesta archives, which you can find [here](https://rjkooiker.shinyapps.io/carifesta-archives/).

Perhaps I have outdated views on what historians do, but I presume they often do often have one or several particular archive and speak of them in these terms. You might go to study the papers of person X or dig through the records of organization Y. To declare something one's archive is to claim a kind of possession over it. As a historian you might claim a particular archive to set yourself apart from the *other* historians, who have not (yet) studied it. That's how you set yourself up to compete for academic prestige.

Whether we say so or not, these are the implicit rules of the game we play. But the particular nature of 'my' archive--that of the Caribbean Festival of the Arts--prevents me from playing the usual game. Maybe that's a good thing.

## There is no Carifesta archive.

You might presume that the Carifesta festivals would already have their own archive somewhere. As a researcher, I could then travel there and spend a few weeks combing through it. That idea quickly falls apart. If any organization can be said to preside over Carifesta, it's CARICOM (the Caribbean Community), a supranational organization that includes most of the anglophone and some hispanophone Caribbean countries. But they have not kept anything like a consistent record of the festivals over the years. Those records, if they have been kept at all, remain in each of the host countries--of which there have been many throughout the region. 

The closest thing we have to a unified Carifesta archive exists as a digital collection on the website of the [Digital Library of the Caribbean](https://dloc.com/collections/icarifesta), a cooperative of partner instutitions based out of the George A. Smathers Libraries at the University of Florida. CARICOM, in fact, will direct you there, since they have helped coordinate various efforts by Carifesta host countries to digitize newspaper clippings, ephemera, and other records pertaining to the festivals from the various national libraries that hold them. 

DLOC's Carifesta collection is an invaluable resource, without which I would not be able to further research the history of the festival. But it has shortcomings, too: there are no video or audio records, almost all their sources are in English, the metadata is flawed, and it skews toward a select few editions of the festival. The balkanization of that archive is the very issue that Carifesta was originally meant to overcome. In addition, DLOC does not contain personal testimonies or collections from people who actually attended the festivals. Those are some of the most valuable sources.

### Why mapping?

So here I am, mapping something like my archive to answer those insistent questions that remain in the back of my mind. By doing so, I can show you how there is no such thing as *my* archive of Carifesta, nor is there *one* that I could claim.

There isn't one--because there are dozens. 

The simple answer to that question--why mapping?--is that mapping creates order out of disorder. It creates transparency where there was opacity. It makes things searchable and accessible when previously they were not. Maps hold both promise and peril. The visual layout and appearance of maps convey arguments in themselves and do so differently than text.

On the one hand, it's valuable to show that Carifesta archives are out there--hard to find as they sometimes may be. Mapping those archives can help other scholars find sources online, so they can plan where and how to travel to those archives if needed. It shows that, despite the seeming obscurity of the event, there are abundant textual and audio-visual records of the events, if you know where to look. Most of these archives are not just about Carifesta; they are Caribbean archives, produced by Caribbean people in the diaspora or in the region, which happen to contain Carifesta materials. To plot the location of these Carifesta records demonstrates both the dispersal and the awareness of the festival far beyond the immediate Caribbean region as well as the depth of historical sources about the events within the region.

Caribbean Studies projects in digital humanities have shown us the multiple innovative uses that mapping can have for answering our research questions and addressing issues of equity. [This map](https://archipelagosjournal.org/issue01/bonilla-visualizing.html#fnref:11) re-frames the cartographic picture of the Caribbean region to bring attention to the complexities of sovereignty and non-sovereign territories in the region. [Another](http://revolt.axismaps.com/) visualizes tactics of resistance and revolt in 18th-century Jamaica that would not have become apparent otherwise. The project [Queering the Map](https://www.queeringthemap.com), "a community-generated counter-mapping platform for digitally archiving LGBTQ2IA+ experience," also contains dozens of contributions in and from the Caribbean. The [Same Boats](https://sameboats.org) project shows the intersecting trajectories of Caribbean writers and artists as they traveled with their ideas in the Black Atlantic and beyond.

My own map depends on in-person archival research, yes, but most of the entries so far have come from advanced Google searching and hours of sleuthing through databases and repositories. I've gone through dozens of finding aids for specific personal papers or institutional records that I knew might have a Carifesta connection from prior research.

As historian Lara Putnam [wrote](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article/121/2/377/2581842) back in 2016, "Digital search has become the unacknowledged handmaiden of transnational history." I have only been able to start my research on Carifesta because of digital resources and digital search capabilities, provided by Google or the websites of institutions that hold Carifesta-related materials. The digital realm invites one to cross borders and access sources that once would have required expensive and burdensome travel. I can request scans of archives from all over the world. I can collaborate with people; I can hear their voices and see their faces as they speak to me about Carifesta from far away. Digital search has shown me how far and wide Carifesta materials have traveled in the world. The digital uniquely affords us this kind of "peripheral vision," to speak with Putnam again.

### Mapping and Transparency

On the other hand, digital tools--such as search and mapping--create the illusion of transparency and completeness. If it doesn't show up on a google search, does it exist? I won't go into all the issues here, but to name a few. To think of such transparency as an unequivocal good is exploitative thinking. "If we examine the process of understanding people and ideas from the perspective of Western thought," [to quote Martiniquan philosopher Edouard Glissant](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Poetics_of_Relation/h3tD8xbekLYC?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA190&printsec=frontcover&dq=if%20we%20examine), "we discover that its basis is this requirement for transparency." To confuse possession with total knowledge is the colonist's error. It mistakes [the map for the territory](https://monoskop.org/images/3/33/Wynter_Sylvia_2006_On_How_We_Mistook_the_Map_for_the_Territory_and_Re-Imprisoned_Ourselves_in_Our_Unbearable_Wrongness_of_Being_of_Desetre.pdf), as Sylvia Wynter would say.

My process clearly imposes such transparency.

Digital search omits the value of local knowledge about why certain repositories were acquired and managed. It reinforces anglophone dominance. The friction associated with analog research is not something to be optimized away; it can provide significant datapoints about the very history we are researching. Digital search doesn't show you all the places where you might have expected a hit, but didn't. It can't account for silence. Map markers abstract these sites of recordkeeping into locations defined by a set of coordinates, instead of ["places"](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Perception_of_the_Environment/5LpTBInNGkEC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22ordinary%20wayfinding%22) that have ["histories"](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Perception_of_the_Environment/5LpTBInNGkEC?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=%22ordinary%20wayfinding%22) and local meaning. Maps work and look the same no matter where you are located on them. Historical knowledge, however, is always situated knowledge: the landscape of history looks different based on your location and perspective.

The basis for any web-based map is a dataset. In my case, this dataset is simply a spreadsheet with columns and rows. Each row contains one repository or sub-repository. For instance, the John La Rose papers at the George Padmore Institute in London has several collections that have Carifesta materials; they span several rows in my dataset. Each column represents some aspect of the metadata about that repository that can help us: where it is located, which specific box or folder numbers have the materials, whether there is a finding aid available, and so on. Of course, much that's interesting or relevant for such a repository is difficult to capture in metadata. I still haven't decided whether or how to include the collections of people who haven't donated their materials to an institution. Some categories of sources are not and will never be in archives. Oral history is part of my work, too, but it can't be included in this map in the same way.

When you search different portals for archives around the world, such as ArchiveGrid, it becomes apparent very quickly that there is a huge disparity in digital infrastructure between the Global North and Global South. That the DLOC is such a helpful and *necessary* initiative with so many resources of Caribbean origin only proves this point. My map will show you immediately that many Carifesta resources are held in the Global North. They are often the best indexed and most easily accessible ones. Some libraries in the Caribbean may well have relevant materials, but you wouldn't know it from afar.

Merely info-dumping sources online is no answer to the problem of silenced histories either. Churn and ongoing maintenance are even more vital for digital than for print resources. The number of outdated and unused digital humanities projects is high. One reason is that people have failed to consider how these resources will end up in the hands of people who will actually use them.

### Unmapping and Opacity

I believe that the answer to the legitimate worries about the illusions or ideologies of transparency is not to let the Carifesta archives that are out there, seemingly silenced or forgotten, linger in obscurity. It doesn't mean giving up on the digital.

The question for me--to map or not to map--involves balancing the value of transparency with the value of its opposite: opacity, the things that remain "unknown and unknowable about the Caribbean," [as Tao Leigh Goffe put it](http://archipelagosjournal.org/issue05/goffe-unmapping.html#fnref:14).  Opacity, Glissant specifies, "is not the obscure," but rather "that which cannot be reduced." How to acknowledge the value of opacity, reclaimed by Edouard Glissant as a *right*, within a system that hard codes transparency? How to encode and visualize ambiguity?

I'm still experimenting with this. But here are some ideas for countermapping or unmapping:

1. Juxtapose sites of memory--possibly crowdsourced--versus the sites of official or institutional records.

2. Apply color shading or blurring to map markers where metadata is unavailable or more ambiguous. NULL does not equal VOID.

3. The digital map, generated using Leaflet, automatically centers itself based on the distribution of markers, which would skew it toward the Global North. Override this default setting to instead center the Caribbean.

4. Enable the user to overlay the map with historical maps produced and designed as part of Carifesta.

5. Use polygons or other shape markers to indicate 'ghost' records, by which I mean material that I know once existed but that is now missing or untraceable. So far, several records or artefacts that I've inquired to see at certain archives have turned out to be lost.

6. Find ways to incorporate provenance data: that is, the trajectories these sources have taken over the course of their existence.
